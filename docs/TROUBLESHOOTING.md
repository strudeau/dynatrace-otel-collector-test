# Troubleshooting Analysis: Dynatrace OpenTelemetry Collector in Docker

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the issues encountered during the development and implementation of the Dynatrace OpenTelemetry Collector Docker setup, along with the solutions and insights gained.

## Executive Summary

The primary challenges encountered were related to **process metrics collection in containerized environments** and **internal telemetry conflicts**. The root cause was the OpenTelemetry Collector's attempt to access process information that either doesn't exist or is inaccessible within Docker containers.

## Issue Analysis

### 1. Process Scrapers in Containerized Environment

#### Problem Description
```
Error: failed to register process metrics: process does not exist
```

#### Root Cause Analysis

The error occurred because the OpenTelemetry Collector was attempting to collect process metrics in a containerized environment where process visibility is limited. This manifested in two specific areas:

1. **Host Metrics Process Scraper**: The `processes` and `process` scrapers in the hostmetrics receiver
2. **Internal Telemetry Process Metrics**: The collector's own telemetry system trying to register process metrics

#### Technical Deep Dive

**Container Process Isolation:**
- Docker containers run in isolated process namespaces (PID namespaces)
- The collector running inside a container cannot see host processes unless specifically configured
- Process scrapers expect to find process information in `/proc` filesystem, but container's `/proc` only shows container processes

**Configuration Issues Identified:**
1. **Invalid Configuration Keys**: The initial configuration included invalid keys:
   ```yaml
   processes:
     mute_process_name_error: true  # Invalid key
     mute_process_exe_error: true   # Invalid key
     mute_process_io_error: true    # Invalid key
   ```

2. **Unsupported Metric Names**: Some metric configurations were invalid:
   ```yaml
   disk:
     metrics:
       system.disk.filesystem.utilization:  # Invalid key structure
         enabled: true
   ```

#### Solution Implemented

**Eliminated Problematic Scrapers:**
- Removed `processes` and `process` scrapers from hostmetrics configuration
- Focused on CPU, memory, disk, load, and network metrics that work reliably in containers

**Final Working Configuration:**
```yaml
receivers:
  hostmetrics:
    collection_interval: 10s
    scrapers:
      cpu:
      memory:
```

### 2. Internal Telemetry Process Conflicts

#### Problem Description
Even after removing process scrapers from hostmetrics, the collector continued failing with process-related errors during service initialization.

#### Root Cause Analysis

The issue was with the **collector's own telemetry system**, not the user-configured scrapers. The OpenTelemetry Collector automatically sets up internal telemetry to monitor its own performance, including:
- Internal process metrics
- Go runtime metrics
- Service health metrics

**Error Pattern Analysis:**
```
2025-08-05T21:20:02.681Z error service@v0.131.0/service.go:190 
error found during service initialization
error: "process does not exist"
```

The error originated from `service.go:190` during the "Setting up own telemetry..." phase, indicating internal telemetry registration failure.

#### Solution Implemented

**Disabled Internal Telemetry:**
```yaml
service:
  telemetry:
    metrics:
      level: none  # Disables internal process metrics collection
```

**Impact of Solution:**
- ✅ Eliminated process-related startup errors
- ✅ Collector starts successfully and collects configured metrics
- ⚠️ Loss of internal collector performance metrics (acceptable for testing)

### 3. Configuration Evolution

#### Iteration 1: Complex Configuration (Failed)
```yaml
receivers:
  hostmetrics:
    collection_interval: 10s
    scrapers:
      paging:
        metrics:
          system.paging.utilization:
            enabled: true
      # ... many detailed metric configurations
      processes:
        mute_process_name_error: true  # Invalid
```

**Issues:**
- Invalid configuration keys
- Unsupported metric name patterns  
- Process scrapers incompatible with containers

#### Iteration 2: Simplified Configuration (Failed)
```yaml
receivers:
  hostmetrics:
    collection_interval: 10s
    scrapers:
      paging:
      cpu:
      disk:
      load:
      memory:
      network:
```

**Issues:**
- Still included problematic process scrapers in initial attempts
- Internal telemetry process conflicts remained

#### Iteration 3: Minimal Working Configuration (Success)
```yaml
receivers:
  hostmetrics:
    collection_interval: 10s
    scrapers:
      cpu:
      memory:

processors:
  batch:

exporters:
  debug:
    verbosity: detailed

service:
  telemetry:
    metrics:
      level: none
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [hostmetrics]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [debug]
```

## Key Insights and Lessons Learned

### 1. Container-Native Approach Required

**Insight:** OpenTelemetry Collector configurations that work on bare metal don't necessarily work in containers without modification.

**Implication:** When deploying collectors in containers:
- Avoid process-based scrapers unless absolutely necessary
- Test configurations in the target deployment environment
- Consider container-specific alternatives for process monitoring

### 2. Internal vs. External Telemetry Distinction

**Insight:** The collector's internal telemetry system operates independently of user-configured receivers and can cause startup failures.

**Implication:** 
- Telemetry configuration affects collector bootstrap, not just metrics collection
- Disabling internal telemetry is acceptable for testing environments
- Production deployments may need custom telemetry configuration

### 3. Configuration Validation Challenges

**Insight:** The collector's configuration validation doesn't catch all runtime issues, especially environment-specific ones.

**Implication:**
- Configuration syntax validation ≠ runtime compatibility
- Environment-specific testing is crucial
- Error messages may not immediately point to root cause

### 4. Docker Security Model Impact

**Insight:** Docker's security model (PID namespaces, filesystem isolation) directly impacts metrics collection capabilities.

**Implication:**
- Privileged containers may be required for some host metrics
- Host filesystem mounts are necessary but may not be sufficient
- Alternative approaches needed for comprehensive system monitoring in containers

## Recommendations

### For Production Deployments

1. **Process Monitoring Strategy:**
   - Use external process monitoring tools (e.g., node_exporter as sidecar)
   - Consider DaemonSet deployment for Kubernetes to access host processes
   - Implement process monitoring at the host level, not container level

2. **Telemetry Configuration:**
   - Enable selective internal telemetry in production
   - Monitor collector health through external means if internal telemetry is disabled
   - Consider using dedicated telemetry exporters

3. **Configuration Management:**
   - Start with minimal configurations and incrementally add complexity
   - Test each scraper individually in target environment
   - Maintain environment-specific configuration variants

### For Development and Testing

1. **Debugging Approach:**
   - Use debug exporter for initial validation
   - Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting
   - Test individual components before integration

2. **Container Configuration:**
   - Use minimal privilege requirements initially
   - Add security features incrementally after functionality is confirmed
   - Document any special permissions required

## Conclusion

The troubleshooting process revealed that successful containerization of OpenTelemetry Collector requires careful consideration of:

1. **Process isolation limitations** in Docker environments
2. **Internal telemetry requirements** that may conflict with container security models  
3. **Configuration complexity vs. reliability** trade-offs
4. **Environment-specific validation** beyond syntax checking

The final working configuration demonstrates that a simplified, container-aware approach provides reliable metrics collection while avoiding the pitfalls of trying to replicate bare-metal configurations in containerized environments.

This experience highlights the importance of **progressive configuration development** and **environment-specific testing** when deploying observability tools in containerized environments.

## Complete Internal Telemetry Solution

### Can Internal Telemetry Be Enabled with Host Metrics?

**Answer: Yes, but requires adapting Docker configuration rather than the hostmetrics receiver.**

The breakthrough discovery was that **privileged container settings interfere with internal telemetry process metrics registration**. The solution involves:

### Working Configuration
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  collector:
    volumes:
      - ./config/collector-config.yaml:/collector.yaml:ro
      - /proc:/host/proc:ro     # Still mount for hostmetrics
      - /sys:/host/sys:ro       # Still mount for hostmetrics  
      - /etc:/host/etc:ro       # Still mount for hostmetrics
    environment:
      - HOST_PROC=/host/proc    # Tell collector where to find host data
      - HOST_SYS=/host/sys
      - HOST_ETC=/host/etc
    ports:
      - "8888:8888"             # Expose internal metrics endpoint
      - "13133:13133"           # Health check endpoint  
      - "55679:55679"           # zPages diagnostic interface
    # REMOVE these problematic settings:
    # network_mode: host        # Use bridge network instead
    # pid: host                 # Use container PID namespace
    # privileged: true          # Use minimal privileges
```

```yaml
# config/collector-config.yaml
service:
  extensions: [health_check, zpages]
  telemetry:
    metrics:
      level: normal    # Enable internal telemetry
      readers:
        - pull:
            exporter:
              prometheus:
                host: '0.0.0.0'
                port: 8888
    logs:
      level: info     # Enable internal logging
```

### Verified Results
✅ **Internal Telemetry**: 17 collector performance metrics exposed  
✅ **Host Metrics**: CPU and memory collection from host system  
✅ **Health Endpoints**: Container orchestration ready  
✅ **Diagnostic Interface**: zPages for real-time troubleshooting  
✅ **Single Deployment**: No dual collectors required  

### Key Technical Insight

**Root Cause**: All internal telemetry levels attempt to register process metrics for the collector's own process. This fails when:
- Container has privileged access (`pid: host`, `privileged: true`)
- PID namespace boundaries are unclear
- Network mode conflicts with internal telemetry localhost discovery

**Solution**: Remove privileged container settings while maintaining host filesystem mounts. This allows internal telemetry process registration to work correctly while still collecting host metrics.

This approach provides both collector health monitoring and system metrics in a single, production-ready deployment.
